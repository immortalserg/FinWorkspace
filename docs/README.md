## Quick answers

- **I can't register the first account.** Registration is invite-only, so create the first admin from the command line. See [Getting started](getting-started.md#3-create-the-first-admin).
- **The container restarts in a loop.** A startup check failed. Run `docker compose logs app`, then see [Configuration](configuration.md#startup-validation).
- **How do I back up?** See [Operations](operations.md#backups).
- **Bank sync returns no accounts.** See [Bank connection](bank-sync.md#troubleshooting).
