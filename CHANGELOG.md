# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Releases that add database migrations or new `.env` settings say so, so you know what to check before updating. Migrations always apply automatically on start, so [back up first](docs/operations.md#backups).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2026-10-31

No database migrations and no new `.env` settings.

### Changed
- Rebranded the application as **FinWorkspace** across the interface, PWA metadata, Docker image, package metadata and documentation.
- Updated the primary container image name to `ghcr.io/immortalserg/finworkspace`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-10-31

No database migrations and no new `.env` settings.

### Fixed
- Pin NumPy below 2.4 to preserve compatibility with older x86 CPUs and virtual machines that do not provide the x86-64-v2 instruction set.


## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-30

No database migrations and no new `.env` settings.

### Added
- Application settings management in the Admin interface, including encrypted storage of API and SMTP secrets.
- Enable Banking private-key upload and removal.
- Initial Luxembourgish (`lu`) interface localization, with English fallback for untranslated text.

### Fixed
- Persistent application settings are loaded on startup and validated together with environment configuration.


## [1.3.2] - 2026-10-25

Adds migration `026`. No new `.env` settings. Migrations apply automatically on start, so [back up first](docs/operations.md#backups).

### Fixed
- Reconnecting a bank no longer creates a duplicate account and re-imports its history. Accounts are matched by Enable Banking's stable account hash, since the account id changes with each authorisation. Accounts linked before this fix learn their hash on the next sync, so sync once after updating and reconnect before the old authorisation lapses. Accounts already duplicated by the old behaviour are not merged. (#59)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-10-20

No new migrations and no new `.env` settings.

### Fixed
- A transaction's details no longer crowd the footer with buttons that overlap. Linking a repayment now lives in a **Repayments** box in the body.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-20

Adds migration `025`. No new `.env` settings. Migrations apply automatically on start, so [back up first](docs/operations.md#backups).

### Added
- **Shared expenses.** When you pay a bill for a group and friends send you their share, link those repayments to the expense. Totals then count only what you really spent: a €100 dinner repaid with €33 + €33 counts as €34 of spending, and the repayments no longer count as income. One expense can take several repayments and one transfer can cover several expenses. Account balances are unchanged. (#46)
  - Link from the row menu ("Link repayment…" / "Mark as repayment…") or from a transaction's details, which list the links with an unlink button and show what was paid, paid back and counted.
  - Works for bank-synced transactions too; pending ones can be linked once the bank books them.
  - Reports, the CSV export, budgets, trackers, budget alerts, forecasts, insights and the AI advisor all use the amounts after repayments.
- Right-click (or long-press) a transaction to open its actions menu.

### Fixed
- Choosing an action from a transaction's row menu no longer also opens its details behind it.
- The Reports page refreshes after a transaction changes.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- File import wizard is complete: pick the file's date format, choose the account, review rows, skip duplicates, set categories, flip signs, and import. The page explains the accepted file format and offers a template. (#37)
- Import review is a paginated table with search and select-all, and you can name the date, description and amount columns when a file has several candidates.

### Fixed
- Import parser handles Greek bank exports (cp1253, accented headers, metadata lines above the header) and reports unreadable rows instead of dating them today.
- A file import can no longer be confirmed twice.
- `.xls` files can be imported.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-05

Adds migration `024`. No new `.env` settings. Migrations apply automatically on start, so [back up first](docs/operations.md#backups).

### Added
- **Multiple API keys.** Create up to 10 named keys from **API Keys**, each read-only (GET requests only) or full access, and revoke them one at a time. The list shows when each key was created and last used.
- **API key guide.** The API Keys page now explains how to authenticate with the `X-API-Key` header, what read-only and full access mean, and lists the main endpoints grouped by area with copy-able `curl` examples.
- **Last login** column on the Admin users table.
- **Delete invite codes** from the Admin page, in any state. Anyone who already registered with a deleted code keeps their account and data.
- **How to invite someone** guide on the Admin page, and used invites now show the user's email instead of an id.

### Changed
- API keys are now stored as hashes and shown once. Your existing key is migrated to a "Default key" with full access, so current integrations keep working.
- API keys can no longer create or revoke API keys; that requires being signed in.
- `/api/auth/api-key` is replaced by `/api/auth/api-keys`. Only the bundled web app used it.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-03

No new migrations and no new `.env` settings.

### Fixed
- The app could stall for about 30 seconds, mostly while loading the dashboard, and then return a 500. Authentication and file-upload handlers ran blocking database calls on the event loop, so once the connection pool filled up nothing could release a connection. They now run in the thread pool.
- The AI chat no longer holds a database connection for the whole streamed answer; tool calls and usage bookkeeping use short-lived sessions.
- The investments watchlist refreshes stale prices concurrently under a 5 second limit instead of one ticker at a time, and no longer holds a connection while waiting on Yahoo.
- Investment sync fetches chart-history candles before opening its write transaction, so a slow broker no longer blocks other writes.
- Every request was logged twice (once by uvicorn, once by the app logger). Only the app logger remains.
- A brand-new Docker install started with an empty database: the entrypoint created no tables but still stamped Alembic at head, so account creation failed with `no such table: users`. `init_db()` now registers all models itself. If you hit this, delete the empty `data/finance.db*` files and start again.

### Changed
- Investment sync and the notification check now start 2 minutes and 1 minute after boot instead of immediately, so they don't compete with the first page load after a restart.
- The SQLite connection pool is larger (20 + 20 overflow) with a 10 second timeout, so exhaustion fails fast.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-03

First public release.

### Added
- Accounts, transactions (income, expense, transfer, split), categories and categorization rules.
- Budgets, recurring expenses, debts (snowball and avalanche comparison) and goals.
- Reports with saved views, scheduled report emails and CSV export, plus a dashboard.
- Bank sync through Enable Banking (PSD2, read-only), with consent-expiry reminders.
- Investments: Freedom24 and Binance sync, portfolio analytics, ticker comparison, backtesting and scenarios, technical analysis, company research.
- AI advisor through OpenRouter with a model picker, cost caps, skills and an investor profile with undo.
- Email and Web Push notifications with quiet hours and de-duplication.
- Documents, trackers, English and Greek interface, light and dark themes, installable PWA.
- Invite-only registration, email verification, password reset and rate limiting.
- Prebuilt multi-arch (amd64 and arm64) Docker image on GitHub Container Registry.
- Full documentation in [`docs/`](docs/README.md), an ISC `LICENSE`, and CI and release workflows.

### Changed
- The Privacy Policy and Terms pages read the operator's name, contact email and jurisdiction from the server instead of compiled-in values. **Action required:** set `LEGAL_OPERATOR_NAME`, `LEGAL_CONTACT_EMAIL` and `LEGAL_JURISDICTION` in `.env`. Until you do, those pages show a "not configured" notice. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md#legal-pages).
- `docker-compose.yml` now names the published image. `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` updates without building.
